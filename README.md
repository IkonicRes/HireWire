## Description
I wanted to show my understanding of mySql and databases by making a program that allows people to manage their staff. The user can add new roles, departments, and employees, all with a cycleable menu. Additionally, the program has the ability to update employee roles and assign specific manager ID's to each employee, or leave manager ID empty if there is no direct manager for the hire.

## Installation
Just clone the repo, make sure to have node installed and run "npm install" to install required dependencies

## Usage


Make sure to make a .env file and set your mySql and db credentials in this format:   
DB_HOST=YOURHOSTADDRESS(CAN BE LOCALHOST)  
DB_USER=YOURSQLUSERNAME  
DB_PASSWORD=YOURSQLPASSWORD  
DB_NAME=hirewire_db  
in the project's root directory, then from the same place run "npm start" in the terminal. 
Here is a video walkthrough of the program:
